# Project Title

**An exercise with Playwright**

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to write automated tests using Playwright.

This project will perform the following tests on the playwright.dev home page in different browsers:

1.Check if the page includes the word “playwright” in the title.
2.Go through the “Get Started” link to find an “Installation” headline.

The project will start with a simple test and gradually add more features to demonstrate how to use Playwright’s advanced features.

## Getting Started

Before you can run the tests in this project, you will need to install Node.js. 

## Dependencies

This project requires Node.js and Playwright to be installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository by running git clone https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/qa-masterclass
